				<p>	The automatic driving system has entered the automobile market, but currently, only one agent, either a human driver or automation system, can be assigned to control a vehicle during a given time interval. That is, when drivers want to revise the planned route of the automatic system, the only thing they can do is to completely shut down the automatic driving system and revert back to traditional driving. In this case, there is no chance for the automatic driving system to learn and adapt or adapt to the driver’s intentions within its own algorithm. Therefore, we propose a continuous control sharing scheme: human and automation could both act on the steering wheel - human through biomechanics but automation through proportional gain.

				<p> Under one mode in which automation adopts a modest mechanical impedance, drivers are allowed to revise the route by acting on the steering wheel.  At the same time, they are informed about the automation’s intent through haptic feedback from the steering wheel. They can also feel how hard or with what impedance they should express their own driving commands on the steering wheel.  Under another mode in which the automation adopts a high impedance, the automation has absolute control over the vehicle.  The high impedance can be felt by the drivers and they are reminded through what feels like a very “stiff” steering wheel that the automation is in control.</p>

				<p>	To supplement the exchange of information which takes place through the steering angle and the mechanical impedance of the steering wheel, we introduce inflatables into the design of the steering wheel. Under normal air pressure, inflatables attached to the steering wheel are soft and deformable. However, at much higher pressure, the inflatables become strongly stiff which provides a totally different tactile feel for drivers to get easy differentiation. We propose to use such an inflation scheme as a supplement or perhaps as a substitute for the impedance of the automation.  The state of inflation of bladders attached to the steering wheel is likely more easily, readily, and more rapidly perceived by the human driver. Plus, by reading the pressure gauge, the automatic driving system is able to determine the grip force of the human driver and perhaps the desire for the driver to wrest control from the automation system.  </p>
