				<p>In this project, an automated parking system is designed for vehicles under reasonable speeds. We linearized and discretized Dobins continuous vehicle model and applied an LQR controller to achieve trajectory following function in both forward and backward moving. The system could tolerance the deviation of the starting position in a 2-4m-radius circle with the deviation angle between +-35 degrees when the stabilized tracking deviations were less than 0.2m. </p>

					The parking structure we defined in this project is a 2 * 3 parking space (shown in Figure 1) with each spot has the dimension as 2.7 m * 6.1 m. The lower center spot is left specifically for our test car and each other 5 spots can be set to be either occupied or available to reflect different situations, which will lead to different level of difficulty for collision avoidance.</p>

				<p><span class="sp">Trajectory |</span>
					To simplify parking spot selection procedure, we directly assumed that no matter whether other five spots are occupied, the test car will only head to the target parking location. Then, we designed two trajectories: forward parking and backward parking. For forward parking(shown in Figure 2.a), the front of vehicle head into the target location first: the car first follows a straight line in the lane, and then makes a 90-degree right turn to adjust the head facing the spot. After the right turn, the car moves straight towards the spot and stop when the center of the car reaches the center of the parking spot. Different from forward parking, backward parking(shown in Figure 2.b) involves an additional reversed motion. The vehicle first turns left for 45 degrees to leave more space for back up and then takes a right-back 45-degree turn followed by a straight reverse motion the final position was reached.</p>

					The car is represented by a 4.6m * 1.9m rectangle where the center of the rectangle indicates the current position of car in x and y coordinate and r indicates the radius of turning. Steering angle is determined by δ and the heading direction is indicated by θ. The model we chose was the classical Dobins car continuous kinematic model. However, for our discrete controller, we need to linearize and discretize this system to meet our needs. After linearization with reference to trajectory we get:</p>

   						<!-- <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2. Parking Path: (a) Forward; (b) Backward</p> -->
   					</div>
   					<p>with x=[x ; y ; θ], u=[Vr, δ]. Then the discrete state space can be derived as:</p>

   						<!-- <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2. Parking Path: (a) Forward; (b) Backward</p> -->
   					</div>
   					<p>where Ts is our sampling time.</p>

   					<p class="gap"> </p>
				<p><span class="sp">Control |</span>
					The controller works for making the test car to follow the desired parking trajectory. The method used for path tracking is Linear Quadratic Regulator. Plus, a collision check is based on the region of each car which is covered by three identical circle with radius R, as shown in Figure 3. A collision will be announced when the distance between any of the origins on the moving car and any of the origins on any of the stationary cars is less than the diameter of that detection circle. Once a collision is detected, the program will report the collision.</p>
